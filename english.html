            Thanks to the <span>Open Source</span> and the <span>#WeAreNotWaiting</span> community, they have made available to those who are ready to take up the challenge, a technology that pharmaceutical companies are taking a long time to develop, and which they are now taking a lead from.

            <h2 class="">TYPE 1</h2>

            <p><span>Type 1 diabetes</span>, which accounts for 5-10% of all diabetes cases, is often confused with its distant relative, <span>type 2 diabetes</span>, which dominates at over 80%. Type 2 is characterised by insulin resistance as insulin is still produced by the pancreas.
            <br><br>
            Type 1 is an <span>autoimmune disease</span>: antibodies mistakenly attacked the beta cells of the pancreas, the ones that produce insulin - the hormone without which we cannot live - and destroyed them completely.
            The onset of the autoimmune reaction that causes type 1 diabetes depends on a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and infections with enteroviruses.
            <br><br>
            This chronic disease, since <span>insulin</span> must be administered for life, often develops in childhood, though it can occur at any age. People living with type 1 diabetes are more likely to trigger other autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis or even rheumatoid arthritis.

            <h2 class="">LOOP</h2>
            <p>The adventure of DIY closed loop systems, also known as <span>DIY artificial pancreas systems</span>, began in 2013. Dana Lewis first created a solution to make her own continuous glucose monitor (CGM) alarms louder. Within a year, she was able to “close the loop” and create a hybrid closed loop artificial pancreas system to automate microadjustments of insulin delivery. Dana looked to the open source world as a way to pay it forward and enable others to self-build their own systems.
            <br><br>
            <span>Closed loop systems</span> are the holy grail for people living with type 1 diabetes. They allow a considerable improvement in quality of life, in the short and long term: less hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, more time in the glyceamic target range, a reduction in hbA1c, the possibility to exercise more easily, to have a better sleep, and to <span>alleviate some of the mental load</span>.

            <p>Loop is an <span>iOS app</span>. It has been developed as an open-source, shared project. The project continues to be a labour-of-love by a community of users - maintained and improved by volunteers.
            <br><br>
            The Loop app is an insulin delivery system that uses commercial and open-source hardware and software technologies.
            <br><br>
            The system bring together:<br>
            - an insulin pump<br>
            - a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)<br>
            - an insulin dosing algorithm<br> 
            - an iPhone and/or an Apple watch<br>
            - a <span>RileyLink</span>, a little device that helps them speak to each other by radio communication and Bluetooth<br>
            <br><br>   
            The <span>algorithm</span> predicts future glucose based on basal-rate schedules, carbohydrate intake, insulin on board, and current CGM readings. These glucose forecasts provide the app with the information needed to recommend a temporary basal rate to attain a targeted glucose range in the future.

            <h2 class="">PEER SUPPORT</h2>
    
            <p>The <span>#WeAreNotWaiting</span> community is people from all over the world, helping each other on a daily basis via social media - in real life meetings as well, before Covid came into the picture. Making the decision to build your own Loop or OpenAPS system, because it is experimental, is often preceded by a long mental journey. Then you have to gather the components, some of which can be hard to come by, such as vintage insulin pumps with the compatible firmware.
            <br><br>
            It's also a real challenge to build your own app, install <span>Homebrew</span>, get familiar with <span>Xcode</span>, <span>GitHub</span>, manage your own data in the cloud building a <span>NightScout</span> website - one of the cornerstones of the DIY closed loop systems.
            <br><br>
            The pioneers of these artificial pancreas systems helped each other, and passed on their experience and expertise. This willingness to <span>share</span> is the essence of the community.<br>
            A big thank you to all the inspiring women who keep it going today: Dana, Callie, Katie, Hanne, Melody, Andrea, Adriana, Katarina, Melissa, Mary Anne, Renza, Saskia, Justine, Maite, Dawn, and so many others.
